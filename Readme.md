Computer Knowledge Test

This project was developed by Sammy Gonzales at Anne Arundel Community College. The purpose of this project is to administer a practice test for students of a computer sciences class.
Overview

The application presents a series of computer knowledge questions to the user. Each test taker is presented with 10 randomly selected questions from a pool. The application immediately informs the user whether the answer is 'Correct' or 'Incorrect'. At the end of the test, the application displays the total score out of 10. The test has a timer that gives a maximum of 30 minutes for completion.
